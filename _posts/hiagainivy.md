hi
i'm writing this from sydney's couch and i think it's a crazy thing to be familiar with a home that's not yours. almost more familiar, actually. 
it's brighter in the divets of my head, sharper than i'd like to admit

last time i was home, it took a few days to remember the placements of the bowls in my kitchen
where is the cheese grater? the pot holders?

whenever i'm here i feel so old, which is weird considering i'm around an adult consistently, a rarity at school
but my mom was my age in the stories she tells of spending holidays at her friends' homes in iowa for breaks
and here i am in massachusetts

when i think of where i live i have never once thought of massachusetts as my home state
but it's where i am now, and where i'll be for a long time, likely

it's weird getting settled somewhere
